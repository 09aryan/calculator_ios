An iOS calculator app made in Swift typically includes a user interface with buttons for numbers, arithmetic operators, and other functionality like clear and delete buttons. The app should be able to handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should also include advanced functions such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions. The app should also have a history log to keep track of previous calculations.

In terms of the implementation, the app will use Swift programming language to create the logic for the calculations and the user interface will be built using UIKit. The app will use functions to handle arithmetic operations and display the results on the screen. It will also use buttons to capture user input and perform the corresponding calculations.

Overall, an iOS calculator app made in Swift should be user-friendly, intuitive, and accurate in its calculations.
